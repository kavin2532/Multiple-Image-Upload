METHOD 3:

PyTesseract [1] is the to-go library for extracting text from images. It uses classical computer vision methods to perform optical character recognition (OCR), then features neural network components such as LSTM from its fourth version onwards.

You may ask: Is there any alternative that is as good as PyTesseract for OCR? Yes, EasyOCR [2] it is. It is a new, deep learning-based module for reading text from all kinds of images in more than 80 languages.
